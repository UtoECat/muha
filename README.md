# platforms
Linux... And just linux... Windows officially not supported
# Make
for make this just open a directory with clonned repository and run *make*. Also you should install gstreamer libs, glut libs and other.
# Run
For run it, open terminal in dir with clonned repository and maked runnable file, and write *./run*. Running from other catalogs probably can make some problems.
# Score
Your score is saved in dir with ./run file. It name is *score.cfg*. For down your scores to ZERO just clean all information on it.
# What is slimeengine?
It's a my second project, that i will make soon... maybe... But now it's unusable at all! DON'T CLONE IT NOW! I will delete it, when all will be done.
